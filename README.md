# -Madhav-E-Commerce-Dashboard
This project involved creating a Power BI dashboard for Madhav Super Store to track e-commerce performance. I visualized sales, product categories, customer behavior, and monthly trends. I used slicers and filters to allow dynamic data exploration, which improved decision-making and operational analysis for the business.
